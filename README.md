## Todo

- ~~Create the board~~
- ~~The color of the board can be changed with a click~~
- ~~Instruction for player in top menu~~

- ~~Next/Undo function~~

- ~~Add Bottom text panel with game state~~
- ~~Add possibility to create own board~~
- ~~Add tests~~

## What is it about?
The numbers at the edge of the diagram indicate how many black boxes (numbers at the top and left) or white boxes (numbers at the bottom and right) make up the longest sequence (continuous amount of fields) in a given row or column. Blacked out fields using these coordinates will create a drawing.
